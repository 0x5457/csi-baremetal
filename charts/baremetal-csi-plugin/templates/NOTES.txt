This CSI made for collaborating with Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage.
To work correctly you need to install ECS Flex Operator and ECS Flex Cluster.
But also you can use CSI independently. In that case you need to create own PVCs
and use correct storage class name: {{ .Values.storageClass.name }}

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.
